# Disaster Recovery Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the disaster recovery procedures for the Labubu Collectibles e-commerce platform. The system uses SQLite database with automated backups and manual recovery procedures.

## Backup Strategy

### Automated Backups
- **Frequency**: Daily at 2:00 AM
- **Retention**: 30 days
- **Location**: `backend/backups/`
- **Format**: SQLite files with timestamp
- **Verification**: Automatic integrity checks

### Manual Backups
- **Command**: `node scripts/backup.js backup`
- **Verification**: `node scripts/backup.js list`
- **Cleanup**: `node scripts/backup.js cleanup`

## Disaster Scenarios & Recovery Procedures

### 1. Database Corruption

**Symptoms:**
- Application crashes on startup
- Database queries fail
- Error messages about database integrity

**Recovery Steps:**
1. Stop the backend application
2. Check backup integrity: `node scripts/backup.js list`
3. Restore from most recent backup: `node scripts/backup.js restore backups/backup-[timestamp].sqlite`
4. Restart the backend application
5. Verify application functionality

**Verification:**
- Check admin panel loads correctly
- Verify orders are accessible
- Test user authentication

### 2. Complete Server Failure

**Symptoms:**
- Server unreachable
- Application completely down
- No response from API endpoints

**Recovery Steps:**
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Notify stakeholders of downtime
   - Post maintenance notice on website
   - Monitor customer communications

2. **Server Recovery:**
   - Restore server from backup or rebuild
   - Install application dependencies
   - Restore database from backup
   - Configure environment variables
   - Restart application services

3. **Verification:**
   - Test all critical functions
   - Verify payment processing
   - Check email notifications
   - Monitor error logs

### 3. Data Loss (Partial)

**Symptoms:**
- Missing orders or user data
- Inconsistent database state
- Reports showing incorrect data

**Recovery Steps:**
1. **Assessment:**
   - Identify affected data
   - Determine scope of loss
   - Check backup timestamps

2. **Recovery:**
   - Restore from appropriate backup
   - Replay any missing transactions
   - Verify data consistency

3. **Communication:**
   - Notify affected customers
   - Provide status updates
   - Offer compensation if necessary

### 4. Security Breach

**Symptoms:**
- Unusual login activity
- Suspicious transactions
- System performance issues

**Recovery Steps:**
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Change all passwords and keys
   - Review access logs
   - Notify security team

2. **Investigation:**
   - Analyze breach scope
   - Identify compromised data
   - Document incident details

3. **Recovery:**
   - Restore from clean backup
   - Update security configurations
   - Implement additional security measures

4. **Communication:**
   - Notify affected users
   - Report to authorities if required
   - Provide security updates

## Backup Management

### Creating Backups
```bash
# Manual backup
node scripts/backup.js backup

# List available backups
node scripts/backup.js list

# Clean up old backups
node scripts/backup.js cleanup
```

### Restoring from Backup
```bash
# Restore from specific backup
node scripts/backup.js restore backups/backup-2024-01-15T10-30-00.sqlite
```

### Automated Backup Schedule
```bash
# Add to crontab for daily backups at 2:00 AM
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/backend && node scripts/backup.js backup
```

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Health Checks
- Database connectivity
- Application response time
- Error rate monitoring
- Backup success verification

### Alert Thresholds
- Application downtime > 5 minutes
- Database errors > 10 per hour
- Backup failures
- Unusual traffic patterns

## Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)

| Scenario | Target RTO | Maximum RTO |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Database corruption | 15 minutes | 30 minutes |
| Server failure | 1 hour | 4 hours |
| Complete data loss | 2 hours | 8 hours |
| Security breach | 4 hours | 24 hours |

## Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

| Data Type | Target RPO | Maximum RPO |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Orders | 1 hour | 4 hours |
| User accounts | 1 hour | 4 hours |
| Product catalog | 24 hours | 48 hours |
| System logs | 1 hour | 4 hours |
